so I can fix them right away

_________

**Try it out:**

Run the following on a machine with NodeJS and npm installed:

`npm install -g app-daemon-js`

then run

`appdaemon-js`

you should see some sample config and a sample app put 
in your home directory under `.appdaemon-js/`

that's the default config directory, 
you can also specify a different directory via

`appdaemon-js ~/.path/to/config/directory/`
